Teaching myself performance software development

Inspired by Sergey Slotin's [Algorithms for Modern Hardware](https://en.algorithmica.org/hpc). I started reading this book recently and it really opened my eyes to a lot of performance software principles.  

This repo is a collection of my notes and experiments while I teach myself these techniques. Some references:
- [Curious Coding](https://curiouscoding.nl/) - particularly, [this post](https://curiouscoding.nl/posts/static-search-tree/), which introduced my to Algorithmica 
- [MIT 6.172](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-172-performance-engineering-of-software-systems-fall-2018/) - an excellent course on the subject, which much of this repo will be also inspired by
- [Techniques of High-Performance Computing](https://tbetcke.github.io/hpc_lecture_notes/intro.html)
- [Programming Parallel Computers](https://ppc.cs.aalto.fi/)
- [perf-ninja](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-ninja) - book PDF located [here](https://github.com/dendibakh/perf-book/releases/tag/2.0_release)
